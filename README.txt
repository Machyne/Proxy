This is a caching HTTP Proxy created in Python.

It handles both Get and Head requests (others such as Post are unimplemented).

This was compliant with standards and RFC 2616 as of November of 2011.
It has not been editted since.

This was written as my final project for my Networks class at Carleton College.

Note: we advise running this in it's own folder -- as cached files become invalid,
	old folders (i.e. all empty subdirectories) are deleted.
